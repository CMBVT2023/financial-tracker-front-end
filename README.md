# financial-tracker-front-end
Front end for a financial tracker. This project is my final project for the bay valley tech module 4 course.

This project requires utilize my [financial-tracker-api](https://github.com/CMBVT2023/financial-tracker-api.git) to handle all database interaction.

My financial tracker project allows you to enter all financial purchases and allows you to view them in an organized table.
It allows for ease of editing any previous entries and allows you to easily delete them as well.
All entries are separated based on user accounts.
